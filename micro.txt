MICROTECH ENGINEERING is a LEAN organisation where continuous improvement is at the core of all operations. At our premises in Gweedore, we implement 5S Workplace Organisation â€“ a workplace organisation method used to organise a work space for efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order.

Quality control is the foremost consideration at each stage of the MICROTECH ENGINEERING production process.

Maintaining the required quality levels requires the creation and upkeep of an environment in which both management and employees strive for perfection. MICROTECH ENGINEERING strive to achieve this by training personnel, creating benchmarks for product quality, and testing products to check for statistically significant variations.

Embedded into our production process is continuing quality-checks. We have the ability to measure any component precisely with regard to 3D CAD or we can reverse Engineer components from the physical component to yield a 3-D geometric model which we can then manufacture. To perform this we use a variety of measuring equipment including CMM and the Equator gauging system.

We place a very high value on our quality standards and work towards exceeding the expectations of our customers in relation to their quality expectations. To help us achieve our quality objectives, we implement the IATF 16949 standard. This is a technical specification aimed at the development of a quality management system that provides for continual improvement, emphasising defect prevention and the reduction of variation and waste in the automotive industry supply chain.

Our overall Quality Control Management system is externally certified to the internationally recognised ISO 9001 and has been audited and approved by our OEM clients and to VDA standards.
